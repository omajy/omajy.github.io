I'm a final year computer science student at The University of Adelaide.

I've recently experienced a growing interest in Machine Learning and Data Science, so I chose to swap my major to AI.

In an ideal future, I would like to work interstate or overseas, and be able to use Mandarin as part of my profession.

Outside of this, I'm also interested in Quantum Computing and am interested to see what opportunities will open up in this field in the future.

This website serves as a record for my experience as a CS student, a showcase of my personal project developments, and a waypoint for any academic updates I have to share.

So, stay tuned for more to come in 2025!
