My name is Jameson, and I'm a final year computer science student at The University of Adelaide majoring in AI. 

I have a strong interest in Data Science and Machine Learning, and have been working on a number of projects to improve my technical skills and understanding of this challenging field. 

In the future I would like the opportunity to work internationally, leverging my Mandarin as part of my profession on a global scale. 

I'm also interested in Quantum Computing, and am interested to see what opportunities will open up in this field in the future.
