<p>I developed a maze solver which implements a breadth-first search algorithm. The program first identifies the starting and
ending nodes of a 9x9 2D array, then uses the BFS to explore the maze, marking valid paths '0' while avoiding obstacles, or <i>walls</i> '1'. 
Key functions include printMaze for visualisation, isValidStep for step validation, and bfs for the core search algorithm.
By packtracking the parent array, visited nodes can be tracked and the shortest path reconstructed, displaying the maze with the path highlighted as '#'.</p>

<p>This project was a short, fun opportunity to gain a better understanding of algorithmic programming in C++ and how different data structures can be utilised to solve problems.</p>
