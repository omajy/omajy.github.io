<p>I sourced a student dataset from Kaggle and used Pandas to pre-process and understand the data fields including name, 
    nationalility, city, age, and grades in English, maths, science, and language.</p>

<p>I analysed the top-performing demographics in each subject and explored the correlations between these factors and academic performance, 
    visualising the findings using Matplotlib and Seaborn.</p>

<p>This was my first python data analsyis and machine learning project. I chose to use the
    scikit-learn library, training a Random Forest Regressor to predict certain grades based on an input of
    demographic data, and tthen assessing its performance and the limitations of the dataset and challenges I faced.</p>
